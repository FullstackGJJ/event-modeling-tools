Resource for compiling tools necessary to make event modeling as good as it can be

If you want to read up on what event modeling is read this [article](https://eventmodeling.org/posts/what-is-event-modeling/)

Currently, event modeling is primarily used to describe user and system interactions. It is a great tool for requirement gathering and domain modeling. I see great potential in test specifications, scenario previewing, and snapshot views of different scope of the project and systems. I think that event modeling is a very intuitive way to think about design and has the potential to clarify even the structure of code in a project. I think we can put it to the test as an alternative form of documentation (good documentation can be hard to come by). I even want to try out showing an event model as a form of demonstrating setup instruction or bug reproducer.

The diagram shown below is a fairly thorough template of what event modeling would look like. I might even play around with making it vertical instead of horizontal.
